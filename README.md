# CS224N Notes with COSE461 Insights

## Overview

This repository contains my English notes on Stanford's **CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning** in Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) format. Alongside lecture notes, I have included code implementations for important/recurrant information with their corresponding outputs. Additionally, this repository incorporates insights and lecture material from **Professor Byung Jun Lee's COSE461 course**.

## Contents

- **CS224N Assignments**: All four official assignments from CS224N, including my solutions.
- **COSE461 Final Project**: My final project for COSE461, complete with a LaTeX research paper.
- **Lecture Notes & Code**: Key takeaways from both CS224N and COSE461, combined with Python code implementations.

## Setup Instructions

To re-run the code implementations in the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual Python environment with python=3.12
   ```bash
   conda create -n cs224n python=3.12
   conda activate cs224n
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
